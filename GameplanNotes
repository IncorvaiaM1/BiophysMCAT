Here are some game plan notes:
- The time at which order is achieve at which magnetic field strength 
- kappa (1/s) how quickly do they align at higher and higher kappa values or higher field strengths mT 
- How time scale so you know no matter what field you set you can tell when order is achieved 
- phase diagram as a function of N and for a constant field strength and 


- nematic orders a functions density and show the different density for the drug delivery and so on as use cases 
- plot nematic order as function of density 
- label density as specific parm 
- plot of nematic order for different magnetic field strength 

nematic 
acute tensor 
look into equation 5 - could be problematic 
 - 10% agreement which shows generally bad experimental agreement

 nematic order as a function nof time
 nematic order as a function of density 
 and then talk about the bacterial rapidly multiply and the density
