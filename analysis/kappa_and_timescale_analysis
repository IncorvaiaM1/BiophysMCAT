What This Script Does:
Analysis 1: Alignment Timescale vs Magnetic Field (τ vs B)

Measures how long it takes to achieve order at different field strengths
Extracts the power law relationship: τ ∝ B^n
Tests if τ × κ is constant (universality check)
Answers: "Time at which order is achieved at which magnetic field strength"
Analysis 2: 2D Phase Diagram (N vs B)

Full phase space showing nematic order S(N, B) as a heatmap
Shows critical field dependence on particle density
Identifies operating windows where S > 0.8 (ordered regime)
Answers: "Phase diagram as function of N and for a constant field strength"
Analysis 3: Application Windows with Density Labels

Plots nematic order vs area fraction φ at different field strengths
Overlays application-specific density ranges:
Drug delivery (high density)
Skin infections (medium density)
Biofilms (very high density)
Microfluidics (controlled systems)
Answers: "Nematic order as function of density... show different density for drug delivery"
Key Features:
- JAX JIT-compiled timescale fitting functions for speed
- Automatic CSV export of results (timescale_vs_B.csv, phase_diagram_2d.csv)
- Publication-quality figures with proper labels and thresholds
- Kappa calculations (κ = 0.01 × B²) explicitly tracked and plotted
- Universality analysis (τ × κ product) to validate alignment kinetics
